# IronPython-Integration
Few examples of hosting IronPython inside .NET

Forked from sakowiczm/IronPython-Integration.

This is a set of example scripts for hosting IronPython from a WinForms application.
Most of the work was already done by the original application.  

I've extended it to pass a form reference directly to the python script which allows calling methods on the form directly from the Python script.
